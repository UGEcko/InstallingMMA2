This is a instuctional repo showing how to install MMA2 (Mediocre Map Assistant 2.)
# 1 - Downloading
Downloading MMA2 and the overall setup is pretty unessessarily difficult, especially for new mappers. 

Please follow this link to the official BSMG Dev Website that holds MMA2 hosted by Top_Cat, and download the MMA2.zip:
